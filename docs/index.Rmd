This workshop is an introductory workshop in Linear Mixed Models in R.

It will cover some basic information on how to identify if a data-set is ill-suited for standard linear models, and mixed models are better.

After this it covers how to specify linear mixed models, inspect the model output, and create tables and figures based on the model results. 

The `dragons` data set used in this workshop is shamelessly stolen from [Gabriela Hajduk's introduction to LME's.](https://gkhajduk.github.io/2017-03-09-mixed-models/)
Her excellent tutorial is highly recommend, which I also have somewhat adapted my own workshop.

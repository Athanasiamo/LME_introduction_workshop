# Linear Mixed Models workshop materials

In this repo you should find the materials for my workshops in Linear
Mixed models.

The `dragons.RData` file in the `data` folder is shamelessly stolen from
[Gabriela Hajduk’s introduction to
LME’s.](https://gkhajduk.github.io/2017-03-09-mixed-models/) She has
an excellent tutorial that I highly recommend, on which I also have
somewhat adapted my own workshop.

The Rmarkdown files used to make the slides can be found in the `docs`
folder, and the finished rendered slides may be found on this repos
associated [github
pages](https://athanasiamo.github.io/LME_introduction_workshop/).

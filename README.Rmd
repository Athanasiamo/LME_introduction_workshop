# Linear Mixed Models workshop materials

In this repo you should find the materials for my workshops in Linear Mixed models. 

The `dragons.RData` file in the `data` folder is shamelessly stolen from [Gabriela Hajduk's introduction to LME's.](https://gkhajduk.github.io/2017-03-09-mixed-models/)
She has an excellent tutorial that I highly recommend, on which I also have somewhat adapted my own workshop.

The Rmarkdown files used to make the slides can be found in the `docs` folder, and the finished rendered slides may be found on this repos associated [github pages](https://athanasiamo.github.io/LME_introduction_workshop/).
